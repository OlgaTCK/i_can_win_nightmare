Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water 
And I think of all the things of what you're doing 
I my head I paint a picture

Since I've come home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Oh, won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

Valerie
